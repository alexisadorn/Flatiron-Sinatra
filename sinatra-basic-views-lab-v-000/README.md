You've been hired to build an app for the local bowling alley. They want a page that displays their regular hours, dates of tournaments, bowling alley bar menus, and eventually, a way to reserve and pay for a lane online.

But for now, they'll settle for just the basics.

### Step 1:

Start by writing the HTML in `index.erb`. Run the rspec tests to make sure you have the appropriate content on the page.

### Step 2:

In `app.rb`, you'll want to create a controller action responds to a GET request and loads `index.erb` in the browser.
